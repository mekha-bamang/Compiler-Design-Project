# Compiler-Design-Project
In this project, I have implemented various phases of the Compiler using tools like- Lex & Yacc. The compiler I have created takes the source/input code language i.e Java and gives Machine code as the output, along with it's various intermedite phases including the parse tree and the symbol table.
## Mini Java Compiler using C .

Instruction to run the compiler :

Input file : code.java
